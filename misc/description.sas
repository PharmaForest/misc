DESCRIPTION START:
### misc ###

This is a package to place miscellaneous macros, functions, etc. which do not need its own package.

Package in general needs several components(macros, functions, etc.) grouped into that specific purpose. However, we sometimes have macros, functions, etc. which does not have such colleagues with the same purpose. Misc is the place of gathering these macros, functions, etc. without necessity of creating new package for it.
