### misc ###

This is a package to place miscellaneous macros, functions, etc. which do not need its own package.

Package in general needs several components(macros, functions, etc.) grouped into that specific purpose. However, we sometimes have macros, functions, etc. which does not have such colleagues with the same purpose. Misc is the place of gathering these macros, functions, etc. without necessity of creating new package for it.

## `%xpt2sas()` macro <a name="xpt2sas-macros-1"></a> ######

`%xpt2sas` is a macro to convert xpt files into sas7bdat files.

### Parameters
	- `indir` : full path for directory with xpt files

	- `outdir` : full path for directory where sas7bdat files will be output

### Sample code

~~~sas
%xpt2sas(
	indir=C:\place\for\xpts,
	outdir=C:\place\for\sas7bdat
)
~~~

### Notes
- All of xpt files are converted to sas7bdat files

## `%minimize_charlen()` macro <a name="minimize_charlen-macros-2"></a> ######

%minimize_charlen` is a macro to minimize the length of character variables 
based on actual data values.

### Parameters
  - `ds` : dataset name (without libref; defaults to `WORK` if no libref specified)
  - `inlib =` : input library name (default: `WORK`)
  - `outlib = ` : output library name (default: `WORK`)

### Sample code

~~~sas
%minimize_charlen(dm)
~~~
~~~sas
%minimize_charlen(class, inlib=sashelp, outlib=work)
~~~

### Notes
- The macro analyzes all character variables in the specified dataset,
  determines the maximum length actually used, and alters the table to adjust
  each variable's length accordingly.
- If `inlib` and `outlib` are different, the input dataset is copied before adjustment.
- If the dataset has 0 observations, the macro will print a warning and do nothing.
