### misc ###
This is a package to place miscellaneous macros, functions, etc. which do not need its own package.
Package in general needs several components(macros, functions, etc.) grouped into that specific purpose. However, we sometimes have macros, functions, etc. which does not have such colleagues with the same purpose. Misc is the place of gathering these macros, functions, etc. without necessity of creating new package for it.

## `%color_swatch()` macro <a name="colorswatch-macros-1"></a> ######

Program:     color_swatch.sas
 Macro:       %color_swatch

 Description:
     This macro retrieves SAS color definitions from the system registry 
     (COLORNAMES section) and generates a visual color swatch table using 
     PROC REPORT. Each row displays the color name, its hexadecimal code, 
     and a cell shaded with the corresponding color.

 Purpose:
     - Extract color name and hex values from SAS registry
     - Display each color with its background for visual reference
     - Useful for selecting and verifying colors for reports and graphics

 Input:
     - None ()

 Output:
     - A report with three columns:
         1. Color name
         2. HEX code
         3. A dummy column colored with the respective color

 Usage:
     %color_swatch();

## `%minimize_charlen()` macro <a name="minimizecharlen-macros-2"></a> ######

/*

`%minimize_charlen` is a macro to minimize the length of character variables

based on actual data values.

### Parameters

- `ds` : dataset name (without libref; defaults to `WORK` if no libref specified)

- `inlib =` : input library name (default: `WORK`)

- `outlib = ` : output library name (default: `WORK`)

### Sample code

~~~sas

%minimize_charlen(dm)

~~~

~~~sas

%minimize_charlen(class, inlib=sashelp, outlib=work)

~~~

### Notes

- The macro analyzes all character variables in the specified dataset,

determines the maximum length actually used, and alters the table to adjust

each variable's length accordingly.

- If `inlib` and `outlib` are different, the input dataset is copied before adjustment.

- If the dataset has 0 observations, the macro will print a warning and do nothing.

## `%rounddec()` macro <a name="rounddec-macros-3"></a> ######

* MACRO NAME: rounrdDec

*

* PURPOSE:

*

*   Rounds a numeric variable to the specified number of decimal places and

*   converts it to a character variable.

*

* PARAMETERS:

*   trgVal     : (Required) The target variable.

*   dec        : (Required) Number of decimal places.

*

* USAGE:

*   %rounrdDec(trgVal=RES,dec=1);

*

* NOTES:

*   - Only integer values can be assigned to the "dec" parameter.

*   - For example, if set to "3", "1.234" convert to "1.23".

## `%roundsig()` macro <a name="roundsig-macros-4"></a> ######

* MACRO NAME: roundSig

*

* PURPOSE:

*   This macro performs rounding based on the specified number of

*   significant digits.

*

* PARAMETERS:

*   trgVal     : (Required) The target Value.

*   SIG        : (Required) Number of significant digits.

*

* USAGE:

*   %roundSig(trgVal=RES,Sig=3);

*

* NOTES:

*   - Only integer values can be assigned to the "Sig" parameter.

*   - For example, if set to "3",

*     "1.234" becomes "1.23",

*     "12.34" becomes "12.3",

*     "12.34" becomes "12.3",

*     "123.4" becomes "123",

*     "1234"  becomes "1230".

## `%xpt2sas()` macro <a name="xpt2sas-macros-5"></a> ######

`%xpt2sas` is a macro to convert xpt files into sas7bdat files.

### Parameters

	- `indir` : full path for directory with xpt files

	- `outdir` : full path for directory where sas7bdat files will be output

### Sample code

~~~sas

%xpt2sas(

	indir=C:\place\for\xpts,

	outdir=C:\place\for\sas7bdat

)

~~~

### Notes

- All of xpt files are converted to sas7bdat files
